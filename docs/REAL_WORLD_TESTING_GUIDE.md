First, ensure all services are running:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/paritoshsingh/Documents/codes/vs\ code/Opticus/QAAutomation

# Start infrastructure services
docker compose up -d postgres redis minio

# Start Rust core services (in separate terminals)
cargo run --bin website-analyzer     # Port 3001
cargo run --bin visual-engine        # Port 3002  
cargo run --bin test-executor        # Port 3003

# Start Python AI services (in separate terminals)
cd services/python/figma-service && ./start.sh          # Port 8001
cd services/python/document-parser && ./start.sh        # Port 8002

### **Key Metrics to Monitor:**

1. **Coverage Analysis**:
   - UI Coverage: % of UI elements covered by tests
   - Requirements Coverage: % of requirements with tests
   - Overall Coverage: Combined coverage score

2. **Test Categories Distribution**:
   - Unified Documented: Tests covering both UI and requirements
   - UI Only: Tests for undocumented UI functionality  
   - Requirement Only: Tests for requirements without UI
   - Gap Analysis: Tests identifying inconsistencies

3. **Execution Success Rate**:
   - Passed/Failed test ratio
   - Common failure patterns
   - Performance metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Issue 1: Authentication Failures**

```bash
# Test authentication separately
curl -X POST http://localhost:8007/authenticate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-app.com/login",
    "username": "your-username",
    "password": "your-password",
    "headless": false  # Shows browser window for debugging
  }'
```

### **Issue 2: Service Health Problems**

```bash
# Check which services are unhealthy
curl http://localhost:8008/service-status | jq '.services[] | select(.healthy == false)'

# Restart specific service if needed
cd services/python/service-name && ./start.sh
```

### **Issue 3: Figma Integration Issues**

```bash
# Test Figma connection
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/analyze-figma-file \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "figma_file_key": "your_figma_key",
    "generate_tests": false  # Test connection only
  }'
```

## üéØ Best Practices for Real-World Testing

### **1. Credential Management**
- Use test accounts, never production credentials
- Configure MFA with dedicated test TOTP secrets
- Rotate test credentials regularly

### **2. Requirements Documentation**
- Structure requirements in clear sections
- Include acceptance criteria and edge cases
- Use consistent formatting (Markdown recommended)

### **3. Figma Design Preparation**
- Ensure designs are published and accessible
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include interaction states and error cases

### **4. Workflow Configuration**
- Start with quick tests before full workflows
- Use appropriate workflow types for your scenario
- Monitor progress and adjust timeouts as needed

### **5. Results Interpretation**
- Focus on gap analysis results for improvement areas
- Review failed tests for legitimate issues vs. test problems
- Use coverage metrics to guide testing strategy

This guide provides a comprehensive foundation for testing real-world applications using the QA Automation Platform. The combination of authentication handling, AI-powered analysis, and comprehensive test generation makes it possible to achieve unprecedented testing coverage and quality! üöÄ
