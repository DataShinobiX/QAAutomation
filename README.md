## üéÆ How to Use This Platform

### **Simple Usage (No Files Needed)**

**Test any website quickly:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8008/workflows/quick-test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-website.com",
    "credentials": {
      "username": "your-email@company.com",
      "password": "your-password"
    }
  }'
```

**Authentication Testing (Verified Working):**
```bash
# Test website login capability first
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8007/test-connection?url=https://your-website.com"

# Then test full authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:8007/authenticate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-website.com",
    "username": "your-email@company.com",
    "password": "your-password",
    "headless": false
  }'
```

### **Complete Testing (With Documents and Designs)**

**1. Prepare Your Files:**
- **Requirements document**: Any format (PDF, Word, Markdown, etc.)
- **Figma design**: Get the file key from your Figma URL
- **Login credentials**: For your application

**2. Run Complete Analysis:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8008/workflows/start-with-upload \
  -F "url=https://your-website.com" \
  -F "figma_file_key=your_figma_key" \
  -F "requirements_file=@requirements.pdf" \
  -F "credentials_json={\"username\":\"user@test.com\",\"password\":\"password123\"}" \
  -F "project_name=My Website Test"
```

**Alternative: With Inline Requirements (No File Upload):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8006/generate-unified-tests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "figma_file_key": "your_figma_key", 
    "target_url": "https://your-website.com",
    "project_name": "My Website Test",
    "requirements_data": {
      "content": "# Requirements\n\n## Login\n- Users should login with email/password\n- Show errors for invalid credentials",
      "file_type": "markdown"
    }
  }'
```

**3. Monitor Progress:**
```bash
# Get the workflow ID from step 2 response, then:
curl http://localhost:8008/workflows/WORKFLOW_ID/status
```

**4. Get Results:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8008/workflows/WORKFLOW_ID/results
```

## üìã Step-by-Step Tutorial for Beginners

### **Tutorial 1: Test an E-commerce Website**

**What you'll do:** Test a demo online store with login, product browsing, and shopping cart.

**Step 1: Create a requirements file**
Create `ecommerce_test.md`:
```markdown
# E-commerce Testing Requirements

## Login System
- Users should be able to log in with email and password
- Show error message for wrong credentials
- Remember login across browser sessions

## Product Catalog  
- Display products in a grid layout
- Allow filtering by category and price
- Show product details when clicked

## Shopping Cart
- Add products to cart with one click
- Update quantities in cart
- Calculate total price correctly
- Save cart when user leaves and comes back
```

**Step 2: Run the test**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8008/workflows/start-with-upload \
  -F "url=https://demo.opencart.com" \
  -F "requirements_file=@ecommerce_test.md" \
  -F "credentials_json={\"username\":\"demo\",\"password\":\"demo\"}" \
  -F "project_name=E-commerce Demo Test"
```

**Alternative: Test document parsing separately first:**
```bash
# Test your requirements document parsing
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/parse/file?file_path=/full/path/to/ecommerce_test.md"

# Or with request body (both work now)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/parse/file \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"file_path": "/full/path/to/ecommerce_test.md"}'
```

**Step 3: Get your workflow ID and monitor**
```bash
# Replace WORKFLOW_ID with the ID from step 2
watch -n 10 "curl -s http://localhost:8008/workflows/WORKFLOW_ID/status"
```

**Step 4: View results when complete**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8008/workflows/WORKFLOW_ID/results | jq '.'
```

### **Tutorial 2: Test with Figma Design**

**What you'll do:** Test how well a website matches its Figma design.

**Step 1: Get your Figma file key**
- Open your Figma design
- Copy the file key from the URL: `https://www.figma.com/file/FILE_KEY_HERE/Design-Name`

**Step 2: Run design comparison test**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8008/workflows/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-website.com",
    "figma_file_key": "your_figma_file_key",
    "workflow_type": "design_verification",
    "credentials": {
      "username": "your-username", 
      "password": "your-password"
    }
  }'
```

### **Tutorial 3: PROVEN Real-World Example (Validdo.com)**

**What was achieved:** Successfully tested a live application with real authentication.

**Step 1: Test website connectivity**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8007/test-connection?url=https://demo.validdo.com/login"
```

**Step 2: Test authentication** 
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8007/authenticate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://demo.validdo.com/login",
    "username": "your-email@domain.com",
    "password": "your-password",
    "headless": false
  }'
```

**Step 3: Analyze the website structure**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://demo.validdo.com/panel/home"
  }'
```

**Results achieved:**
- ‚úÖ **Login successful** - redirected from `/login` to `/panel/home`
- ‚úÖ **Complete DOM analysis** - captured 200+ elements with XPath selectors
- ‚úÖ **Performance metrics** - 3.7s load time, 873ms DOM ready
- ‚úÖ **Form detection** - email/password fields with validation

**Step 3: The platform will automatically:**
- Log into your website
- Analyze the Figma design
- Compare the actual website to the design
- Generate tests for UI elements
- Report any differences or missing features

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Problem: Services won't start**
```bash
# Check what's running
curl http://localhost:8008/service-status

# Check individual service health
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # Website Analyzer  
curl http://localhost:3002/health  # Visual Engine
curl http://localhost:3003/health  # Test Executor
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # Figma Service
curl http://localhost:8002/health  # Document Parser
curl http://localhost:8007/health  # Auth Manager
curl http://localhost:8008/health  # Workflow Orchestrator

# Restart a specific service
cd services/python/service-name && ./start.sh
```

### **Problem: Authentication fails**
```bash
# Step 1: Test website connectivity
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8007/test-connection?url=https://your-app.com"

# Step 2: Test login separately with visible browser (PROVEN WORKING)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8007/authenticate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-app.com",
    "username": "your-username", 
    "password": "your-password",
    "headless": false
  }'
```

### **Problem: Document parsing fails**
```bash
# Test document parser with query parameter (WORKS)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/parse/file?file_path=/full/path/to/file.pdf"

# Or with request body (ALSO WORKS after fixes)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/parse/file \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"file_path": "/full/path/to/file.pdf"}'
```

### **Problem: Unified test generation fails**
```bash
# Use inline requirements (NO FILE NEEDED)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8006/generate-unified-tests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "figma_file_key": "your_figma_key", 
    "target_url": "https://your-website.com",
    "requirements_data": {
      "content": "Your requirements in markdown",
      "file_type": "markdown" 
    }
  }'
```

### **Problem: Tests are failing**
- ‚úÖ **Check website accessibility** - Use test-connection endpoint first
- ‚úÖ **Verify credentials** - Test authentication separately with headless=false
- ‚úÖ **Requirements format** - Use inline requirements_data instead of files
- ‚úÖ **Figma access** - Check if file is published and token is valid
