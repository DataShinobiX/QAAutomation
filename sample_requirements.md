# Validdo Login & Authentication Requirements

## Project Overview
Validdo is an employee screening platform that requires secure authentication and user management capabilities.

## User Stories

### US001: User Login

- Failed login shows appropriate error message
- Support for "Remember Me" functionality
- Account lockout after 3 failed attempts

### US002: Multi-Factor Authentication
**As a** security-conscious user  
**I want to** enable MFA for my account  
**So that** my account is protected with an additional security layer

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Support for TOTP (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- QR code generation for MFA setup
- Backup codes provided during setup
- MFA required for sensitive operations

### US003: Password Reset
**As a** user who forgot their password  
**I want to** reset my password securely  
**So that** I can regain access to my account

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Password reset link sent via email
- Link expires after 24 hours
- New password must meet complexity requirements
- Old password invalidated after reset

### US004: Account Registration
**As a** new user  
**I want to** create an account  
**So that** I can access Validdo services

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Email verification required
- Password strength validation
- Terms of service acceptance
- Welcome email sent after registration

## Business Rules

### BR001: Security Requirements
- Passwords must be minimum 8 characters
- Must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
- Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)

### BR002: Data Validation
- Email format validation
- Password complexity validation
- Input sanitization for XSS prevention
- CSRF protection on all forms

### BR003: User Experience
- Form validation in real-time
- Clear error messages
- Loading states during authentication
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Login response time < 2 seconds
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- Support 1000+ concurrent users

### Security
- HTTPS encryption required
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting on login attempts

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support

## API Endpoints

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /login` - User authentication
- `POST /logout` - User logout
- `POST /forgot-password` - Password reset request
- `POST /reset-password` - Password reset execution
- `POST /register` - User registration

### Profile Endpoints
- `GET /profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /profile` - Update user profile
- `POST /change-password` - Change password
- `POST /setup-mfa` - Configure MFA

## Test Scenarios

### Positive Test Cases
1. Valid login with correct credentials
2. Successful password reset flow
3. MFA setup and authentication
4. Account registration with valid data

### Negative Test Cases
1. Login with invalid credentials
2. Login with inactive account
3. Password reset with invalid email
4. Registration with existing email
5. Weak password validation
6. SQL injection attempts
7. XSS attack prevention

### Edge Cases
1. Very long email addresses
2. Special characters in passwords
3. Simultaneous login attempts
4. Network timeout scenarios
5. Browser back button after logout
